    <p>Since 2002, the Department of Computer Engineering, VIIT is dedicated to imparting quality education in the field
        of Computer<br> Engineering. We now offer a four-year full-time Undergraduate (B.Tech.) degree program with an
        intake of 240. We offer a<br> Postgraduate program as well, and this year we start with our Ph.D. program
        too.<br>


        The Computer Engineering program has been accredited three times by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) up
        to<br> the year 2021. The department has state-of-art well-equipped laboratories and well qualified, experienced
        faculty who follow the<br> NBA prescribed philosophy of outcome-based education (OBE). Our teaching is
        learner-centric, with importance given to<br> achieving the objectives of the learning process. Our syllabus is
        in line with industry needs and includes contributions from<br> industry experts. Various other activities and
        student interactions, in the department, are planned with a constant awareness of<br> the graduate attribute
        that student should have at the end of the program.<br>


        In the past few months, during the lockdown period due to COVID-19 pandemic, systematic learning continued for
        our students.<br> The faculty immediately switched to online delivery of lectures and practical sessions. Many
        other online activities were<br> organized for students for proper utilization of time. Two such activities are
        a lecture series by Computer Society of India (CSI)<br> and Machine Learning (ML) course by ACM.<br></p>
