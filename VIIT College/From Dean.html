<p>I pleasantly welcome you to Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT). VIIT attained the prestigious autonomous<br>
    status from the year 2017-18. VIIT offers undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes in Faculty of Engineering. VIIT<br>
has adopted the choice-based credit system. VIIT regularly modernizes curricula with a higher standard to attain all the<br>
graduate attributes such as teamwork, communication, ethics, financial and managerial skills etc. along with technical<br>
competence. The institute also has the freedom to evolve methods of assessment of students’ performance, the conduct of<br>
examinations and notification of results.<br></p>
<p>VIIT has adopted the philosophy of outcome-based education. At VIIT, we strive to forge the young students first as competent<br>
    engineers and then imbibe the present-day necessity of technical and life skills into them, whereby they are fully equipped to<br>
    take up the challenges of the industry. Our philosophy is to shape good and competent engineers. VIIT students are now being<br>
    placed not only in industries of repute within the country but also globally with consistently high pay packages. As a result of<br>
    the institute establishing a strong foothold in engineering education, VIIT is accredited with grade ‘A’ by NAAC and all<br>
    undergraduate programs have been granted NBA accreditation. VIIT has also obtained ISO certification.<br>
</p>
<p>At VIIT, ample opportunities, for internships in industry/research institute, industry-sponsored projects and collaborative<br>
    projects with research institutes like TIFR, IISER, IUCAA, etc. are available. As a result of exposure to research experience, many<br>
    of the students go abroad for higher studies. The interaction with industry and research institutes has helped to inculcate<br>
    analytical abilities among the students. The academic and research culture at VIIT helps the students to excel in University<br>
    examinations and placements. Several students from various programs of the institute have topped the rankers list of SPPU<br>
    every year.<br>
</p>
<p>As COVID-19 continues spreading in many countries of the world, VIIT has decided to implement an online education to over<br>
    3500 students from their homes, strong academic system, facilitated by qualified faculty, supported by ICT and state-of-the-art<br>
    infrastructure, make the education process an enjoyable journey for students.<br>
</p>
<p>Welcome to VIIT!</p>
