        The great city of Pune has a rich cultural heritage that goes back to the seventeenth century. It is considered
        as the <br>
        source and inspirational centre for education from the very ancient times. Pune is now known as the Harvard,
        Stanford<br>
        and Michigan of this part of the world. With its round- the- year salubrious climate, it has attracted many an
        industry <br>
        including automobile, general engineering, chemicals and recently the IT. Pune boasts to be the city with scores
        of<br>
        institutes imparting quality education to the young generation for providing the necessary manpower to these
        diversified <br>
        enterprises.<br><br>
        

        The present need of the industry is challenging in that engineers must possess a combination of sound
        technical<br>
        background and IT skills. At the Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, we strive to forge the young
        students<br>
        first as competent engineers and then imbibe the present-day necessity of IT skills into them, whereby they are
        fully <br>
        equipped to take up the challenges of the industry.<br><br>

        Our philosophy is to shape up good and useful engineers and not just graduates. Our students
        are made to face the <br>
        industry head-on by way of numerous industrial projects which expose them to the state-of-the-art technology. We
        <br>
        boast the highest on-campus recruitment and the vast majority of our graduates are accepted by reputed
        American<br>
        universities for higher studies. We have tie-ups with various industries and educational institutions for
        transfer of<br>
        technology. It is therefore not surprising that we get students from all parts of India. We never cease to cope
        up with the<br>
        changing needs of the industry and have started postgraduate programs.<br><br>

        Our principal asset is the highly qualified faculty members, the majority of them with international exposure
        and our fully <br>
        equipped laboratories. Students and guardians are encouraged to have continuous interaction with the faculty for
        a <br>
        seamless understanding of the students progress. We give a keen emphasis on individual student counselling.<br>

        We are in the process of being one of the best engineering and IT institutions of India and are continuously
        putting <br>
        efforts to be the very best to provide quality education and placement at amicable cost.<br>
