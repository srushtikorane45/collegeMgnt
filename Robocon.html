<p>ROBOCON, short for ROBOtic CONtest, is an interesting game cum intellectual exercise 
    for budding engineers and their<br>
    enthusiastic instructors determined to innovate and create machines for producing desired results. Participation in this activity<br>
    is an end-to-end competitive yet fun experience from concept design for a system of robots programmed to perform according<br>
    to the rules of the game played on a high precision technical contest area and to score a victory beating the opponent; all this<br>
    according to the theme declared by the Host country. International Robocon is mainly sponsored by Asia Pacific Broadcasting<br>
    Union (ABU) which includes Doordarshan of India as a member which has been organising all activities in India for last nine<br>
    years with collaboration with MIT Group of Institutions, Pune, India.<br>
</p>
<p>VIIT,Pune is also an active participant in this tech event. Initiated with the support of avid faculty members, VIIT has lot of<br>
    students working and learning high tech skills on this international platform. The college management and all departments<br>
    encourage students from all academic years to actively be a part of this tech team. This is highly recommended as this only<br>
    adds to the knowledge, skills and passion of the students for robots and machines. At the start of every academic year,<br>applications of interested students from diverse domains are called and an introductory session and meetings are held. The<br>
    students are then asked to specify their area of interests and are gathered together. A Team is thus formed. All this process is<br>
    carried out by the senior and experienced students in the guidance of Event Co-ordinator.<br></p>
    <p>Every year, students work on different themes specified by the Host country. Like, the theme for Robocon 2014 was “A Salute to<br>
        Parenthood” and that of Robocon 2013 was “The Green Planet”. This year “Robominton” is the theme for the contest. Robocon<br>
        provides an excellent opportunity for students to enhance their knowledge and make them acquainted with latest technologies.</p>
